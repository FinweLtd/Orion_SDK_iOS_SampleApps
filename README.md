# Orion_SDK_iOS_SampleApps

License
-------

Without a bought license (created specifically for your application package)
the SDK runs in "evaluation version" mode. In this mode only example 
applications can be built.

Modifying example applications is allowed for practising and testing the
SDK, but publishing or redistributing example applications either in
binary or source code format is forbidden.

Customers can freely use code from example applications in their own 
licensed applications.

Also see the end-user license agreement document (EULA) that is included
in the SDK package.

For licensing enquiries, contact sales@finwe.fi

Documentation
-------------

User manual is the best starting point for new users.

Various example applications demonstrate the most common use cases
in practice.

Full API documentation is also included in the release package.
	  
How to try example applications
-------------------------------

1. Set up a typical iOS development environment and test that it works
   e.g. by creating a Hello World type test application from Xcode.
2. Open Terminal application, and navigate to the folder where example
   application’s Podfile exists and type “pod install”.
3. Open cxworkspace file that was created while the pods were installed
   (open Finder application and double click the file).
